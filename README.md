### My motto
Believing in the power of open source and transparency, I am commited to license all my works copylefted(ish). I license all my works in permissive licenses such as WTFPL or Creative Commons. Knowledge should be shared openly, not locked tight.

Oh, this README is licensed under WTFPL, too.
